# ETF-Holdings
Scraping the top 10 ETF holdings from Yahoo finance or other sources to update continuously in an Excel workbook with my ETF allocations

##Purpose##
I want to be able to easily track my single stock weightings across different portfolios to ensure I do not end up overweight in anything through other active strategies. 
Additionally, I want to make sure that my Roth allocation is sufficient for my risk tolerance, and I can have this vehicle on autopilot for the next 30 years.
